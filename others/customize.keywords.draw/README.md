#Draw version 1.0.0

For this version of Draw to work on mobile (or anywhere using the mobile view), the version of _mobile.js in "customize.frontend.commons" must be updated.

This is required because the save button needs to have the class "js-save-instance" in order to be referenced correctly.

The fields marked as $draw do not support duplication in draw version 1.0.0
